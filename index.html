<h2>What is a Backwater Valve? 

<br>Do I have one?</h2>
<p>A backwater valve is a device that prevents sewer water from coming into your home. When the city sewer is full, due to rain or heavy use, the sewer drain attached to your home may become full of communal sewer water, and without a backwater valve, may even back up into your home.

Homes built after 1989 are required to have a backwater valve, so if your home is newer than that, chances are very good you do have one. 
<br>If your home is older and you do not have one currently installed in your home you may be eligible for up to $800 in rebates if you make the decision to have one installed in your home!</p>
